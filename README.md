# Setup
To get setup, run:

npm install - this installs all the bower dependencies (jQuery, Modernizir, etc..)
bower install - this installs all the node modules (grunt-sass, grunt-copy, etc..)
grunt serve - this builds the project, launches a browser, setups up autoreload and gets you going

# Troubleshooting
If you're getting errors on a grunt serve, try an npm install and bower install to see if that helps. If not, contact Dan.
